	abstract = {We consider data transfer between a chemical vapor emitter and photoionization detectors (PIDs) under constant velocity gas flow in a constrained environment (flow tube). We show that the system, though stochastic owing to flow unsteadiness, is (on average) linear and then characterize the channel using a Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion. We measure bit error rates using straightforward detection methods in the KL-produced signal space. Data rates of 20bps are easily achieved at ≈ 10-3 error rate and we suspect that similarly low error rates are achievable at much higher bit rates using suitable adaptive equalization methods.},

	abstract = {We consider data transfer between a chemical vapor emitter and photoionization detectors (PIDs) in a constrained airstream (flow tube). Owing to flow unsteadiness, the system is stochastic so that Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) channel characterization is useful. We project sensor traces onto a K-L-derived signal space, formulate likelihood ratios and obtain high bit rates (≥ 10 bps) at low probability of error (≪ 0.01) over meter-scale emitter-sensor separations. At higher data rates (30 and 40 bps) inter-symbol interference (ISI) requires we enlarge the K-L characterization window to include earlier bit intervals. By taking prior bits into account we achieve error rates on the order of ≈ 0.01 at 40 bps. We consider the effects of flow rate and timing jitter on performance. Within the limits of our experimental apparatus, the probability of error decreases with increasing wind speed, owing to decreased ISI at higher wind velocity, but perhaps also as a result of previously derived fundamental bounds related to jitter.},

	abstract = {Leaves are the most abundant and visible plant organ, both in the modern world and the fossil record. Identifying foliage to the correct plant family based on leaf architecture is a fundamental botanical skill that is also critical for isolated fossil leaves, which often, especially in the Cenozoic, represent extinct genera and species from extant families. Resources focused on leaf identification are remarkably scarce; however, the situation has improved due to the recent proliferation of digitized herbarium material, live-plant identification applications, and online collections of cleared and fossil leaf images. Nevertheless, the need remains for a specialized image dataset for comparative leaf architecture. We address this gap by assembling an open-access database of 30,252 images of vouchered leaf specimens vetted to family level, primarily of angiosperms, including 26,176 images of cleared and x-rayed leaves representing 354 families and 4,076 of fossil leaves from 48 families. The images maintain original resolution, have user-friendly filenames, and are vetted using APG and modern paleobotanical standards. The cleared and x-rayed leaves include the Jack A. Wolfe and Leo J. Hickey contributions to the National Cleared Leaf Collection and a collection of high-resolution scanned x-ray negatives, housed in the Division of Paleobotany, Department of Paleobiology, Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Washington D.C.; and the Daniel I. Axelrod Cleared Leaf Collection, housed at the University of California Museum of Paleontology, Berkeley. The fossil images include a sampling of Late Cretaceous to Eocene paleobotanical sites from the Western Hemisphere held at numerous institutions, especially from Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument (late Eocene, Colorado), as well as several other localities from the Late Cretaceous to Eocene of the Western USA and the early Paleogene of Colombia and southern Argentina. The dataset facilitates new research and education opportunities in paleobotany, comparative leaf architecture, systematics, and machine learning.},

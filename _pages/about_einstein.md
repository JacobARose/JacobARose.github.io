I am a scientist, engineer, teacher and musician. I completed my MSc in Electrical Sciences and Computer Engineering at Brown University, where I was supervised first by Professor Chris Rose and then by Professor Thomas Serre. Before this, I completed my BSc in Physics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Before starting on my PhD, I worked on developing data engineering best practices and computer vision models for agricultural research at Terramera Inc in Vancouver, BC.
